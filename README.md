# Pixel Art Game
This is a fun passion/learning project, based on [TheCherno's](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject) [Game Programming Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYT7Lqt1h8&list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf&index=1).

This project is in C++ using CMake, Ninja, and bash, despite the original tutorial series being in Java. This is a great way for me to learn C++ while having a goal in mind (creating a simple pixel art game)!

First, I need to learn how to setup the project with GLFW/OpenGL, then start to draw pixels to the screen.
